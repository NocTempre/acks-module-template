/**
 * Feeds the canonical IP scanner invented files and checks what it reads and
 * what it says of them. Its long-literal warning measures literals: it fires
 * on a long string or template wherever one sits, and never on a comment or
 * regex that happens to lie between two quote marks. A path is known in any
 * letter case, and a data file that does not parse is still read. Asked with
 * `from`, it judges the text git holds for a path, byte for byte and whatever
 * the work tree holds, and `flagged` names each path it raised an error for.
 *
 * Each case is a throwaway tree of invented files scanned through `scanPaths`,
 * the entry the pre-commit hook and the commit tool use. A case that gives a
 * `from` is a repository as well: `head` is its first commit and `staged` its
 * index, each put there with no file written.
 *
 * Usage:  node bin/test-ip-scan.mjs [<ip-scan.mjs>]
 *         (defaults to skeleton/tools/ip-scan.mjs; pass a modified copy to
 *         confirm a case fails when the behaviour it guards is broken)
