/**
 * Headless capture driver for release snapshots (TOOLCHAIN §4b).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Snapshots have to be taken from the live world during the
 * §4a verification session, and the obvious route — screenshot the browser
 * pane an agent is already driving — does not work: the pane only composites
 * frames while it is on screen, so a headless or backgrounded session times
 * out with no picture. This drives a throwaway Chromium over the DevTools
 * protocol instead, which composites off screen while its page holds the
 * foreground (below), and can clip the capture to one element's bounding box.
 *
 * Clipping is not a convenience. §4b requires the world id, user name and
 * server URL stay out of frame, and Foundry paints all three into the players
 * panel, settings tab and window title. Clipping to the app window excludes
 * them by construction rather than by remembering to crop.
 *
 * The browser it launches is a separate throwaway profile: it cannot disturb a
 * browser the developer is using, and closing UI windows to compose a frame
 * (below) affects only this session's DOM. Nothing the driver does on its own
 * writes to the world; what a run creates through it is recorded in the
 * fixture ledger (below).
 *
 * NOTHING MACHINE-SPECIFIC LIVES HERE. Browser binary, origin and user name
 * are arguments; their values are local-only and belong in the machine's
 * TEST_ENVIRONMENT.md, never in a repo.
 *
 * Requires Node >= 22 (global WebSocket) and a Chromium-family browser.
 *
 * USAGE — one small script per shot. Note the `file:///` scheme: Node's ESM
 * loader rejects a bare Windows absolute path ("protocol 'c:'"), so importing
 * this by drive-letter path fails before anything runs.
 *
 *   import { connect, sleep } from "file:///C:/Proj/acks-module-template/bin/foundry-capture.mjs";
 *
 *   const api = await connect({ browser: EDGE, origin: ORIGIN, user: "Gamemaster" });
 *   try {
 *     await api.compose();                       // clear popups from other modules
 *     // The kept fixture marked "location/inn", or a new one built and marked.
 *     const inn = await api.fixture("location/inn", "Actor", { name: "Inn", type: "acks-extras.location" });
 *     const sel = await api.eval(`(async () => {
 *       const a = await fromUuid(${JSON.stringify(inn.uuid)});
 *       await a.sheet.render(true);
 *       return "#" + a.sheet.id;
 *     })()`);
 *     await sleep(2000);
 *     await api.compose(sel);                    // sweep anything the write popped up
 *     console.log(await api.shot("docs/releases/v0.3.0/location-sheet.png", sel));
 *   } finally {
 *     api.close();                               // prints what the run built and kept — quote it in the report
 *   }
 *
 * THE FIXTURE LEDGER. Every document a run creates is recorded by uuid the
 * moment it exists — `create()` records what it makes; `track()` records one
 * made any other way, including one the feature wrote itself once its id has
 * been read back. A fixture stays in the world for the next check
 * (`.claude/rules/live-testing.md`, step 4), so the ledger is first the
 * run's record of what it built: every `track` prints its uuid and `close()`
 * prints the ledger again. It is also the only list a delete keys on. A
 * check whose subject is setup tracks the kept fixture it retires and calls
 * `sweepTracked()`, which deletes exactly that list, newest first,
 * re-resolving each uuid to prove it is gone, and returns what it removed,
 * what it could not find and what refused to go; the report quotes that
 * object. The world is shared, so a delete keyed on a name, a name prefix,
 * a folder, a type or a time window takes other sessions' documents with
 * yours. A setup check that dies before its sweep has its ids in its log;
 * the next run re-tracks those ids and sweeps — it never goes looking by
 * name. A session driving a browser pane instead keeps the same list and
 * runs `pageSweep(entries)` there — the very expression the driver uses.
 *
 * A KEPT FIXTURE IS FOUND BY ITS MARKER. `fixture(marker, kind, data)`
 * returns the one document whose `flags.world.fixture` is the marker, or
 * builds one from `data` carrying it and tracks that; what it finds it does
 * not track, so a second run's ledger holds only what that run built.
 * `retire(marker, kind)` is a setup check's delete of a kept fixture: the
 * lookup's one document, tracked and swept alone. `mark(uuid, marker)` puts
 * the marker on what a setup check's feature produced. A marker is
 * `<feature>/<name>` as the recipe gives it. A session that builds its own
 * beside a peer's (step 4, a fixture you drive) connects with `own: <tag>`,
 * and every marker it looks up or builds is `<feature>/<name>@<tag>`; the
 * lookup is exact, so the recipe's marker and a peer's never meet. Two
 * documents carrying one marker is a fault and the lookup throws, naming
 * both, rather than pick: a run handed either would build on a fixture the
 * next run may not be handed, and the twin is the trace of two runs that
 * both missed and both built.
 *
 * A FRAME IS TAKEN OF A FOREGROUND PAGE WITH NO TOAST ON IT. A page that loses
 * the foreground is hidden: it paints no frames, its transitions never end and
 * its timers are throttled, so a capture, or a window close awaiting its
 * transition, stops answering there. `compose()` and `shot()` put the page
 * back in front before they do anything (`pageKeeper`) and say so when they
 * found it hidden; a walk's own `api.eval` is not fronted, so close a window
 * there with `{ animate: false }`, as `compose()` does. `shot()` also hides
 * the notification tray for the capture itself, since a toast can land after
 * any `compose()` — to photograph a toast, clip to it.
 *
 * SHOOTING A CHAT CARD takes two extra moves, and skipping either one fails in
 * a way that reads as "the message was never posted":
 *
 *   - **Re-render the Hotbar before any ChatLog render.** `compose()` closes
 *     every application, and `ChatLog#_onRender` reaches into the hotbar
 *     (`_toggleNotifications` → `#offsetHotbar`), so the render throws on a
 *     null element and no log appears. `await ui.hotbar.render(true)` first.
 *   - **Use the POPOUT log, not the docked sidebar.** The sidebar is anchored
 *     to the right edge and sits past the headless viewport, so clipping to a
 *     message in it captures a ~14px sliver. `renderPopout()` gives an ordinary
 *     floating window; `setPosition` it somewhere on screen and clip to the
 *     card's own root — which also keeps the message header, and with it the
 *     seat's user name, out of frame.
